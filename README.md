# PHP Modernity Signature
This project attempts to reliably estimate the age (legacy) of a PHP system using weighed attribute grammars. The goal is to statically analyze a PHP system, so that we can determine, for every nonterminal with alternatives, the probability that every alternative is chosen. We then calculate a _modernity signature_, which summarizes the age of the language constructs used in the code base. The signature should give a general idea on the age of the code base, not on its reliability, security, or other characteristic.

This project is part of my research project for the [37th Twente Student Conference on IT](https://sites.google.com/utwente.nl/37th-twente-student-conference/homepage), which I am performing under supervision of [Vadim Zaytsev](https://github.com/grammarware) and [Marcus Gerhold](https://github.com/marcus-gerhold). As the project is part of my graduation, in order to prevent accidental plagiarism, I am currently not accepting pull requests. Feel free to submit issues if you find them :-).
